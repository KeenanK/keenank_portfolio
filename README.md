### Hello, my name is Keenan Koesnendar. I am from Jakarta, Indonesia. I am 13 years old and I go to Jakarta International School(JIS). I joined this javascript coding camp because I find this interesting, I have never learned about javascript so this is brand new to me. My GitHub username is KeenanK and my email is keenank1912@gmail.com.

# Map Markers
### This is my Map Markers project. In this project I had to mark MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) on the digital map.

# PacMen Factory
### In this project I had to make pacman run around and bump into walls. There are buttons to start the games and buttons to add pacmans.

# Real Time Bus Tracker
### For this project I needed to show the bus stops from MIT to Harvard. When it starts markers pop up of where all the bus stops are.
