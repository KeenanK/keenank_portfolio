### Hello, my name is Keenan Koesnendar. I am from Jakarta, Indonesia. I am 13 years old and I go to Jakarta International School(JIS). I joined this javascript coding camp because I find this interesting, I have never learned about javascript so this is brand new to me. My GitHub username is KeenanK and my email is keenank1912@gmail.com.

# Map Markers
